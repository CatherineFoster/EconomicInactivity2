This paper has shown how a modelling framework, utilising multionomial logistic regression and using data from the UKHLS, can be used to simulate the distributions of persons of working age in different economic activity states under different scenarios, in a way that allows fine-grained controls for the effects of demography and event history, and so estimation of the *ceteris paribus* effects of specific exposure factors of interest on these distributions to be estimated. From this, the framework allows changes in population pool sizes - such as relative changes in the proportion of the population who are economically inactive - which result from changes in exposures to be produced in ways that are interpretable as PAFs and SAFs. 

The examples of exposures demonstrated in this paper relate to health, with one example of modelling health as a discrete variable, and another as a continuous variable (or rather a conceptually linked combination of continuous variables). These two ways of modelling health are not directly comparable - the discrete health variable models removing 'bad health' from afflicted individuals; whereas the continuous health examples involve improving everyone's health by an equal amount - for persons with very poor health before the hypothetical intervention they may still have poor health afterwards, and for someone with very good health before the marginal effects of even better health are likely to be very small - which should explain why the two approaches produce somewhat different PAF-like estimates of the contribution of 'health' to economic inactivity due to long-term sickness: using the discrete example this estimate was around 60% whereas for the continuous examples the estimates were around 30%. However, the main purpose of this initial paper is methodological rather than to provide definitive estimates of the contributions of specific exposures to various economic activity state population sizes. 

This paper has been rigourous in describing how the modelling framework was developed from first principles, through to a specific operationalisation. It has also been rigourous in describing different forms of foundational model specification that meet the requirements for such a specification laid out, as well as showing the differences that the foundational model specification chosen have to the model fit. This has demonstrated that there is not much substantive difference in the accuracy of such models to out-of-sample predictions of next states, even though different foundational model specifications could then lead to quite different PAF-style estimates of the contributions of specific exposures of interest. For reasons of consistency, the same foundational model specification - involving both an interaction term between event history and sex, and a spline function on age with five degrees of freedom - was used for all extended model specifications used. However further research could investigate the degree of dependence PAF-like estimates of exposures of interest have on the choice of foundational model specification. This would be useful for producing estimates of the degree of structural model depedence such estimates have, and so the extent to which such estimates should be considered reliable. 

The data used for the model are from pre-pandemic years, and it is possible the relationship between health and economic (in)activity has changed in the UK as a result of the pandemic and subsequent factors. For example, though it was historically the case that the majority of causes of illness related economic inactivity related to physical health, a substantial growth in reasons for such inactivity now relates to mental health, especially amongst younger working age adults. This could mean, for example, that the health interventions biased towards improving physical health may be less effective than estimated here, as compared with those either similarly balanced between physical and mental health, or biased towards physical health. 

The complex research design of the UKHLS, allowing individuals to be tracked across successive years - called waves - has been of vital importance to allowing the model to be calibrated and developed. However the nature of this research design is that, after the initial sampling of households using the postcode address file, with each successive wave the individuals and households resampled may become decreasingly representative of the UK population as a whole. Because of this cross sectional sample weights are supplied, and reweighting of model outputs using these weightings were conducted. In the example presented the substantive differences between the share of the populations in each economic activity state was small, but in other cases they might not be. 

The number of potential exposure variables that could be modelled using this framework is very large, even if just using those variables reported in the main UKHLS data release. This includes both additional individual level factors - such as a person's highest qualifications - as well as household level factors - such as housing tenure, marital status, and the number and composition of the households in which the individual lives. A number of these additional factors were also modelled but not included as part of this paper for reasons of space and existing methodological complexity. 

As well as the standard public release of the UKHLS, the UK Data Archive also provide access, under special licence, to editions of the dataset in which more sensitive and potentially identifiable attributes are included as part of individual and household level identifiers. This includes urban-rural identifiers and smaller area geography identifiers. These smaller area geographic identifiers mean that local area level variables reported at the same geographic units, such as childcare availability, job density, unemployment rates, median incomes and so on can be attached to the dataset used by this modelling framework, and included as additional exposure variables, further expanding the number of factors whose effects on economic activity status this framework can be used to explore and estimate. 

The UKHLS includes variables on ethnicity and country of origin. The foundational model did not include such variables as part of the specification as they were not found to improve the penalised model scores (AICs and BICs) above models which did not include such factors. However researchers using this framework may wish to consider including such factors, either from first principles as must-include control factors, or as part of extended model specifications. Although conceptually neither ethnicity nor country of origin are actually modifiable as they are historical characteristics, the inclusion of such factors as part of extended model specifications may be justified as ways of estimating the contribution that factors relating to ethnicity and country of origin - such as labour market discrimination against minority groups - may have on patterns of the distribution of economic activity states in minority group populations. This could be accomplished by, for example, setting the status of all minority group members to the majority group status in the counterfactual scenario, and comparing the changes in the distribution of predicted economic activity states in the next wave. 

The examples shown so far all involve modelling the effects of a 'large' intervention over a single time period, i.e. the differences in economic state distributions in the next wave. Potentially, the same framework could be applied to simulate the effects of more modest interventions over a longer time scale. For example, instead of modelling the effects of improving everyone's health by a standardised unit instantaneously - as with the current continuous health modellinging - the effects of improving everyone's health by a 0.1 standardised units consistently over a 10 year period could instead be modelled. This would involve taking the simulated outputs from wave $T$ to $T+1$ and using them as inputs for the model to simulate states at $T+2$, then repeating for as many cycles as desired. As the model specification includes age as foundational characteristics the age should be incremented by 1 for each cycle as well. This approach would have similarities both with approaches used in time series and health economic modelling. 

Currently there are seven mutually exclusive and exhaustive states for economic activity status in the model. By analogy with health economic modelling an additional state to consider including would be death. This would be an example of an absorbing state, where the conditional probability of transitioning to all other states would be 0, in comparison with the seven non-absorbing states at present, in which there are non-zero conditional probabilities of moving from any state to any other state. Given a focus on the working age population, another example of an absorbing state to consider including would be retirement due to reaching retirement age (as opposed to the early retirement state modelled here), although people do work after retirement age, and retirement age itself is changing over time, and so the inclusion of this as a discrete category may be an unnecessary or inappropriate structural constraint depending on application. On the one hand, the appropriateness of including either or both of these absorbing states is likely to increase if simulating over multiple time periods. On the other hand, the number of parameters to be estimated models increases as a multiple of the number of states to model, and so the precision of estimates is likely to decrease as the number of parameters increases. 

All modelling, data preparation, and analytical steps were produced in R, an open-source statistical software language, and the code used, along with additional support material, are freely available as github repositories and other online resources. This should facilitate both the adoption and the refinement of this modelling framework, increasing the transparency with which simulation work related to substantively important questions of the determinants of economic activity and inactivity are conducted.
