## Summary of Key Findings

This paper has shown how a modelling framework, utilising multinomial logistic regression and using data from the UKHLS, can simulate the distributions of persons of working age in different economic activity states under different scenarios. This approach allows for fine-grained controls for the effects of demography and event history, enabling the estimation of the *ceteris paribus* effects of specific exposure factors on these distributions. From this, the framework can produce changes in population pool sizes, such as relative changes in the proportion of the population who are economically inactive, which are interpretable as PAFs (Population Attributable Fractions) and SAFs (Sequential Attributable Fractions).

## Interpretation of Findings

The examples of exposures demonstrated in this paper relate to health, with one example of modeling health as a discrete variable and another as a continuous variable. These two approaches are not directly comparable; the discrete health variable models removing 'bad health' from afflicted individuals, while the continuous health examples involve improving everyone's health by an equal amount. This discrepancy explains why the two approaches produce different PAF-like estimates for the contribution of 'health' to economic inactivity due to long-term sickness: approximately 60% using the discrete example and around 30% for the continuous examples. However, the primary focus of this paper is methodological rather than providing definitive estimates of specific exposures' contributions to various economic activity state population sizes.

## Implications

The framework presented allows for various potential applications. It can be expanded by incorporating additional individual and household-level factors such as qualifications, housing tenure, and household composition. Moreover, by using special license access to more detailed UKHLS data, researchers can include smaller area geography identifiers and local area-level variables, further expanding the framework's utility for exploring and estimating factors affecting economic activity status. This broad applicability suggests significant potential for future research, particularly in areas like health interventions, where the framework could simulate the effects of different types and scales of interventions over varying time periods.

## Limitations

The data used for the model are from pre-pandemic years, and it is possible that the relationship between health and economic (in)activity has changed in the UK due to the pandemic and subsequent factors. For example, historically, most illness-related economic inactivity was due to physical health issues. Still, there has been substantial growth in mental health-related inactivity, especially among younger working-age adults. Additionally, the UKHLS's complex research design, while allowing for longitudinal tracking, may lead to decreasing representativeness over time, necessitating the use of cross-sectional sample weights. While these weights were used in the model, the potential impact of attrition on representativeness, particularly concerning specific UK regions, remains a limitation.

## Future Research Directions

Further research could investigate the degree of dependence PAF-like estimates of exposures have on the choice of foundational model specifications. This could produce estimates of structural model dependence, contributing to understanding the reliability of such estimates. Additionally, there is potential for expanding the model to include absorbing states like death or retirement, especially for multi-period simulations. Investigating the implications of these absorbing states, as well as the trade-offs involved in adding them to the model, could be a valuable area of future study.

## Conclusion

This paper has rigorously described the development and operationalization of a modeling framework that simulates the effects of various exposures on economic activity states. It has highlighted the methodological contributions of the framework and its potential applications for understanding the determinants of economic activity and inactivity. The use of R and the availability of the code as open-source resources enhance the framework's accessibility, facilitating its adoption and refinement by other researchers.
