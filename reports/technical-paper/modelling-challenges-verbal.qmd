The modelling strategy starts with the need to operationalise key assumptions about the economic (in)activity status of individuals over time, factors that may influence an individual’s economic (in)activity status, and the longitudinal study design of the UKHLS. We assume:

1.  An individual can be in one of seven economic (in)activity states at a given time period T; and these states are mutually exclusiveand exhaustive. We use a multinomial logistic regression.
2.  A key factor expected to influence the economic (in)activity state of an individual at time T is their economic (in)activity state in the previous time period T-1. Our model is Markovian.
3.  A person’s age is expected to influence the probability of an individual being in each and every economic (in)activity state, and these effects are likely to be nonlinear. We explored whether age should be included using a polynomial function or spline function.
4.  A person’s sex is also expected to be influential as to their probability of being in and moving to each economic (in)activity state. We explored whether sex should be included an independent or interactive.
5.  Once the modelling framework is sufficient in capturing those qualities represented by conditions (1-4), it should be readily extensible to capture the additional influence that other factors may have on the predicted probabilities of being in each mutually exclusive economic (in)activity state at time $T$. Condition (1) indicates that a multivariate model should be used. By this we mean that the response variable Y comprises a vector of response outcomes, rather than a single response outcome. Knowing additionally from this condition that the states an individual can be in are mutually exclusive and exhaustive leads us to a choice of multinomial logistic regression as our main model framework. Multinomial logistic regression is an extension of standard logistic regression from two mutually exclusive states to K mutually exclusive states, where $K$ is an integer value, which in our case is seven: the number of mutually exclusive and exhaustive economic (in)activity states an individual can be in at a time period $T$.

Condition (2) suggests that we should include economic (in)activity status at time $T$ as a predictor in our model, where the model response is economic (in)activity status at time $T+1$. This inclusion of current state (at time $T$) as a predictor of next state (time $T+1$) means our model is Markovian, in that the influence of recent history is considered an important predictor of current status, but the longer-term history (such as from two or more time periods ago) is only considered to have influenced state at time $T+1$ through its influence on state T. This modelling approach can also be considered a discrete-state analogue of an autoregressive $AR(1)$ model in time series data, though Markovian is a more common way of conceptualising this type of model structure when working with mutually exclusive and discrete states and state transitions between time periods.

Condition (3), when combined with condition (1), suggests that a somewhat generic, generalisable and flexible functional form for capturing the types of influence that age can have on the probabilities of being in each of the seven mutually exclusive states. Call this functional form s(age). Potential candidates for this flexible functional form s(.) include polynomial functions, which are parametric, and spline functions, which are semi-parametric. This functional form should be sufficiently flexible as to be appropriate for all seven age-state schedules, but not so flexible that the number of parameters required to fit it are too large, or the risk of model over-fitting too great.

Condition (4) suggests that sex should be considered as a predictor variable in the model. It could either be included as an independent, non-interacting predictor, or also as a factor which interacts with other factors also included in the model. When considering interaction effects, a standard strategy for determining whether an interaction term is required should be adopted to make this determination.

Condition (5) suggests that, in addition to including the factors implied by conditions 2-4 in the model, it should be possible to decide to add additional variables to this basic specification, which allows for the effect of these additional variables on economic (in)activity states to be estimated, assuming conditions 2-4 are adequately controlled for. Within this paper, we refer to the model that includes current status (condition 2), age (condition 3) and sex (condition 4) as our foundational model, and models which add one or more additional variables of interest to the predictor side of the model as our extended models. It is by comparing scenarios in an extended model, where the variable or variables of interest are changed to one of two conditions, but the foundational model variables are kept constant, that we will be able to produce estimates of the contribution of these variables of interest to economic (in)activity states overall.
