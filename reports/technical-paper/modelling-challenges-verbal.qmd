The modelling strategy starts with the need to operationalise key assumptions about the economic (in)activity status of individuals over time, factors that may influence an individual’s economic (in)activity status, and the longitudinal study design of the UKHLS. We assume:

1.  An individual can be in one of seven mutually exclusive and exhaustive economic (in)activity states at a given time period $T$. Therefore we use a multinomial logistic regression.
2.  A key factor expected to influence the economic (in)activity state of an individual at time $T+1$ is their economic (in)activity state in the previous time period $T$.
3.  A person’s age is expected to influence the probability of an individual being in each and every economic (in)activity state, and these effects are likely to be nonlinear. We explored whether age should be included using a polynomial or spline function within the model.
4.  A person’s sex is also expected to be influential as to their probability of being in and moving to each economic (in)activity state. We explored whether sex should be included an independent or interactive variable within the model.
5.  Once the modelling framework is sufficient in capturing those qualities represented by conditions (1-4), it should be readily extensible to capture the additional influence that other factors may have on the predicted probabilities of being in each mutually exclusive economic (in)activity state at time $T$. Condition (1) indicates that a multivariate model should be used. By this we mean that the response variable Y comprises a vector of response outcomes, rather than a single response outcome. Knowing additionally from this condition that the states an individual can be in are mutually exclusive and exhaustive leads us to a choice of multinomial logistic regression as our main model framework. Multinomial logistic regression is an extension of standard logistic regression from two mutually exclusive states to K mutually exclusive states, where $K$ is an integer value, which in our case is seven: the number of mutually exclusive and exhaustive economic (in)activity states an individual can be in at a time period $T$.

Appendix A discusses the rationale for these conditions in more detail.

Within this paper, we refer to: 

- The **Foundational Model**, which includes current economic status, age and sex. 
- **Extended Models**, which add one or more predictor variables to the Foundational Model. 

By comparing scenarios in an extended model, where the additional variable or variables of interested are changed between scenarios, but the foundational model variables are kepy constant, we are able to produce estimates of the contribution of these variables of interest to population-level economic status.
