# Introduction

There have been important and in some cases troubling trends in working age economic inactivity in the UK, especially in trends towards rising economic inactivity related to ill health.

This paper describes the development and results of a modelling framework that estimates the contribution of health to population-level economic activity and inactivity, controlling for demography and current economic status. The framework is highly adaptable and could be extended to include wider determinants of economic status in addition to health.

## Economic activity and economic inactivity in the UK

Working-age adults in the UK can be divided by their main economic status into the employed, unemployed and the economically inactive. Employed people include employees and the self-employed who do at least one paid hour of work a week plus those temporarily away from work because they are on holiday or sick. Unemployed people are defined as those out of work and are either actively seeking work and are available to start work within the next two weeks or who are out of work, have found work and are about to start employment within the next two weeks. Economically inactive people are those out of work who are not available for or actively seeking employment. The main reasons for working-age economic inactivity in the UK include being in full-time education, long-term illness or disability, looking after home and family and (early)retired [@labourm2020].

Economic status is an important determinant of public health. Working is associated with better mental and physical health, while people who are long-term sick have the worst morbidity [@wilson2015; @brown2012] Unemployed adults and those looking after home and family have intermediate levels of health. Compared to the employed, working-age adults who become or remain unemployed or economically inactive (especially long-term sick or early retired) have an increased risk of mortality [@roelfs2011; @åhs2006; @kim2015]. For economically inactive students, the picture is more complex. Their mental health is poorer than those in employment; however, some evidence suggests this difference may be transitory, with the effect wearing off once they leave full-time education [@mccloud2023].

Health is also an important driver of economic status. In the UK, adults of all ages were more likely to be economically inactive if they had self-reported bad/very bad health than if they had self-reported good/very good health[@dey-chowdhury2022]. Economic inactivity due to long-term sickness has also increased since 2019. While an ageing population and increased waiting lists for NHS treatment may have played a role in this, the UK’s worsening health record was also a major contributory factor [@tinson2022; @howdoes2023].

Since the 1970s in Britain, inactivity has fallen for working-age women and risen for working-age men. Within this, the numbers inactive due to looking after home and family have decreased, while those inactive because of full-time education or long-term sickness has increased [@machin2023; @dar2015]. Alongside this, employment rates for mothers increased steadily in the 1980s and 1990s, while employment rates for people with disabilities declined until the early 1980s and did not recover in the next two decades [@berthoud2007]. Between 2000 and 2018, economic inactivity for adults aged 16-64 fell only slightly, driven by increased labour market participation for women aged 50-64 [@herz].

Of particular concern to policy makers is the number of working-age adults whose economic inactivity is due to long-term sickness. 2.8 million adults in the UK were in this position in January-March 2024 [@labourm]. This reflects both long-term and short-term trends. The long-term trend is a reflection of growing numbers of working-age adults on incapacity benefits (IB) since the 1970s. Both sexes were affected. Male levels increased sharply until mid-1990s before levelling off. Female levels continued to increase after mid-1990s but also levelled off in early 2000s [@anyadike-danes2008]. These changes are likely to be due to a combination of factors: local and regional spatial differences in labour market demand and lower employment prospects linked to poor health and low skills [@beatty2013; @roberts2022; @plotnikova2020; @machin2023]. There is some evidence that economic inactivity due to long-term sickness declined in the UK between the early 2000s and early to mid-2010s. Trends in long-term sickness stopped falling around the middle to latter half of the decade and have subsequently increased [@machin2023]. Quantifying the contribution of these factors to the growth in long-term sickness could help understand what to focus on, to reverse recent increases and prevent further growth.

## Background to modelling strategies and approaches

In this paper, we use multinominal logistic regression to predict the distribution of the working-age population by economic status in the next time period. After creating a foundational model, which includes age, sex and current economic status, we consider two extended model specifications, both of which include at least one health-related variables in addition to the variables in the foundational model.

The first of these extended model specifications uses a binary variable, which is coded as `1` if the respondent reports having a limiting long-term illness, and `0` if they do not. The second extended model specification uses a continuous measure of health, derived from the physical health and mental health components of the Short Form (SF) 12 (SF-12) questionnaire [@ware1996]. We focus here on the pre-pandemic period 2010 to 2019, because the drivers of economic inactivity during the pandemic are likely to be different from those in the pre-COVID years.

# General Methodological Considerations

This section of the paper will approach how we thought about problems, challenges and solutions of building a model that can answer questions on the contributions of specific factors on the levels of economic inactivity and activity in a population. We first describe what the model needs to accomplish; then describe modelling and simulation principles in general; lastly we move towards operationalisation and the specific model structure and content that we use in this manuscript.

## Description of the modelling challenges and how we address them

## Modelling for simulation

Appendix B contains a background to generalised linear models, how they are used for statistical simulation, and the specific type of model specification and processes and analyses conducted. This includes discussion of how the results from statistical simulation can be presented as PAFs and SAFs.

## Data Source Used: The UK Household Longitudinal Study

Our first step was to build a foundational model to predict the future distribution of economic status in the population based on the current characteristics of that population. We do this using individuals’ observed economic states reported across ten waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), 2009-10 to 2018-19. Also known as Understanding Society, the UKHLS is a longitudinal household panel survey that aims to follow all individuals in households selected at random in the first wave, 2009. Even where households move, or individuals in initially selected household form new households, the UKHLS aims to interview them each subsequent year, along with any new household members.

Important strengths of the UKHLS for our purposes are its longitudinal nature and the richness of the data it collects. Because of its longitudinal nature, the UKHLS is ideal for tracking changes in individuals’ economic (in)activity states over time and seeing how a variety of factors at wave $T$ influence the subsequent state at time $T+1$. Its collection of data on income, employment and other labour market outcomes, education, family and health is comprehensive compared to other large-scale surveys [@benzeval2023]. Other advantages of UKHLS include its large sample size compared to other longitudinal surveys, its coverage of all age groups (rather than a specific birth cohort), and its potential for linkage with ecological data and individual-level administrative data. A key limitation is attrition (people dropping-out of the survey) and loss of representativeness over time [@platt2021].

We use all the observations from waves i (2009-10) to waves j (2018-19) for which flows from T to T+1 are available. This means that any one individual can contribute multiple observations to the model, similar to autoregressive time-series models, so the model is based on unique observations, not unique individuals. We excluded waves k (2019-20) to m (2021-22), because changes in economic status are likely to have been affected by the COVID-19 epidemic during these years.

## Categories of economic (in)activity

The UKHLS offers a number of levels of aggregation and disaggregation at which an individual’s economic (in)activity state can be divided. This ranges from two mutually exclusive states, {economically inactive, economically active}, through to a much larger number of economically inactive states. In the case of two mutually exclusive states, economically inactive includes full time students, those inactive for reasons of ill health, and full time carers, even though we may consider these to be qualitatively different categories and experiences. Similarly economically active includes both those who are presently employed, and those who are unemployed but seeking employment: again, qualitatively different categories. In order to be mindful of the hidden heterogeneity involved in the broader categories of economically inactive and economically active, we made use consistently of a seven-level grouping of economic (in)activity types from the UKHLS:

-   Economically Active:
    -   Employed
    -   Unemployed
-   Economically Inactive:
    -   Long Term Sick
    -   Full Time Student
    -   Full Time Carer
    -   Early Retired
    -   Other

Using the terminology introduced in appendix B, our multinomial logistic regression model therefore has K=7 (and so J=6). Each of the seven states is treated as categorical, and model does not ‘know’ (in the sense there are no structural constraints) that, say, Long term Sick and Full Time Student are both types of Economic Inactivity, and that Employed and Unemployed are both types of Economic Activity.

# Results: Developing the extended models

As mentioned there are two types of extended model specification presented here, one in which health is treated as a discrete variable, and another in which health is treated as continuous variables. For both types of model we begin by detailing how the extended model specification was arrived at, before presenting the results of simulations based on the selected extended model specification
