Economic status is an important determinant of health, with unemployment and many forms of economic inactivity associated with worse morbidity and higher mortality. Health can also influence economic status, especially movement from employment to long-term sickness and from long-term sickness to employment. This paper uses modelling to estimate how improvements to health alter the composition of economic status at a population level in the UK.

Descriptive analysis found important differences in characteristics by economic status, with health poorest among the long-term sick, unemployed and early retired. Flows into long-term sickness are largest from unemployment and employment. Factors such as low skills, income, local jobs, car access and childcare may prevent people from moving into work from unemployment or economic inactivity, even if their health improves.

Multinominal logistic regression was used to build a foundational model to estimate the economic status of a population in the next time period, based on age, sex and current economic status. This model was extended to include health as a predictor. The model was then applied to wave i of the UKHLS. We compared the baseline predictions with a counterfactual where the health measures were improved. Improving both mental and physical health, with a bias towards improving physical health more, was associated with the largest reduction in unemployment and long-term sickness, and increased flows into employment, full-time education and early retirement.

Further analysis will build on this methodology to quantify the impact of changes in structural, household and individual level factors on population-level economic status.
