Economic status is an important determinant of health, with unemployment and many forms of economic inactivity associated with worse morbidity and higher mortality. Health can also influence economic status, especially movement from employment to long-term sickness and from long-term sickness to employment. This paper uses modelling to estimate how improvements to health alter the composition of economic status at a population level in the UK, and show how model based population attributable fractions (PAFs) and sequential attributable fractions (SAFs) can be calculated using this approach.

Multinominal logistic regression was used to build a foundational model to estimate the economic status of a population in the next time period, based on age, sex and current economic status. This model was extended to include health as a predictor. The model was then applied to wave i of the UKHLS. We compared the baseline predictions with a counterfactual where the health measures were improved, using two approaches: we first modelled health as a discrete variable, in which limiting long term illness was 'switched off' in a counterfactual scenario to estimate its effects on transitions between states. And we secondly modelled health as a pair of linked continuous health variables - mental health and physical health - in which in the counterfactual scenarios standardised health scores were 'improved' by one standardised unit. 

Although this paper is primarily methodological, the discrete health approach estimated that limiting long-term illness may be responsible for around 60% of economic inactivity due to long-term sickness; and that improving health more generally could reduce economic inactivity due to long-term sickness by around 30%. It appears improvements in physical health tend to reduce the size of long-term sickness related economic inactivity slightly more than equivalent improvements in mental health. 

Further analysis will build on this methodology to quantify the impact of changes in structural, household and individual level factors on population-level economic status.
