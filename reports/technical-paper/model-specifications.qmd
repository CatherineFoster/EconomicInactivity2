### Foundational Model Specification

In appendix B, we state that our model specification must produce predictions of the economic (in)activity status for an individual at time $T+1$, meaning our response is $y= y_{t+1}$, given a predictor matrix $X= \{W,y_t,Z\}$, where $W$ are sociodemographic confounders, $y_t$ is the economic (in)activity status at wave $T$, and $Z$ represents the factor or factors of interest. This general specification still offers many researcher degrees of freedom in terms of how it may be implemented. Our approach was to first select what we call a common foundational model specification, in which $X= \{W,y_t \}$, then use this foundational model specification as the starting point for one or more extended model specifications in which $X= \{W,y_t,Z\}$. We considered it vital that $W$ includes at a minimum adequate controls for sex and age. We also explored the possibility that interactions between components of $W$ and $y_t$ may also be required.

Our final foundational model specification for the predictors $X$ was, using R’s formula interface:

> `next_status ~ this_status * sex + splines::bs(age, knots=2, degree=3)`

Or equivalently:

> `next_status ~ this_status * sex + splines::bs(age, df = 5)`

This final foundatonal model specification was selected after comparing eight possible foundational model specifications that incorporated event history (`this_status`), sex, and non-linear age effects: four specifications that included an interaction term between event history and sex (i.e. representing the concept that conditional transitions between states are influenced by sex), and four that did not. Within each of these groups of four, the number of degrees of freedom (the `df` parameter) in the `bs()` function was changed between 3 and 6. Further details, including results of performing repeated out-of-sample predictive fit estimation on four candidate models, are presented in Appendix D.

Both extended model specifications discussed in this manuscript begin with this foundational model specification, then add on one or more variables to represent the specific factors/drivers of interest $Z$.

### Extended Model Specification 1: Health as a Discrete Variable

Our first extension of the final foundational model specification is an example where $Z$ is a single binary health-related indicator. For this we used the variable `health`, which reports individuals' responses to the following question:

> Do you have any long-standing physical or mental impairment, illness or disability? By ‘long-standing’ I mean anything that has troubled you over a period of at least 12 months or that is likely to trouble you over a period of at least 12 months.[@healthv]

We coded affirmative responses to this question as ‘1’, and ‘0’ otherwise, and referred to this binary coded version of the variable as `lt_condition` in our models. This discrete health extended model specification is therefore the foundational model specification plus this additional variable, i.e.

> `next_status ~ this_status * sex + splines::bs(age, 5) + lt_condition`

To check whether the above specification is sufficient extension of the foundational model when incorporating the possible influence of LLTI, we considered an additional specification including an `health:sex` interaction. However, this interaction term did not lead to an improvement in either AIC or BIC.

### Extended Model Specification 2: Modelling health as a continuous outcome using the SF-12

Our second extended model specification involved modelling health as a continuous rather than discrete variable. For this, we used summary responses from the Short Form (SF) 12, which is a 12-item questionnaire for assessing both mental and physical health asked in each wave of the UKHLS. Of the 12 items in the questionnaire, six items relate to physical health (physical functioning, physical role, bodily pain, and general health), and six items relate to mental health (energy, social functioning, emotional role, mental health) (Turner-Bowker and Hogue, 2014) (Ware et al, 1995). The scores from each of these pairs of six items are aggregated to produce separate mental and physical health component scores; the two scores are not then further aggregated to produce a single overall continuous health score.

For our purposes, we first standardised and normalised both the aggregate mental health and physical health component scores, so that both scores have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. This is to allow us to approach using the model to estimate the contribution that health has on economic (in)activity in a similar way to that used in the first extended model specification. Let us refer to the standardised and normalised mental health component score as $z^M$ and the standardised and normalised physical health component score as $z^P$.

Because health scores from the SF-12 are not further aggregated into a single overall health score, but remain separate variables, there are a number of alternative ways that they can be implemented to form the extended model specification. This includes:

1.  Adding $z^M$ only
2.  Adding $z^P$ only
3.  Adding both $z^M$ and $z^P$ as independent terms
4.  Adding both $z^M$ and $z^P$, including an interaction term between $z^M$ and $z^P$

As elsewhere, we compared these candidate extended model specifications using AIC and BIC. The model specification with the lowest (i.e. ‘preferred’) AIC and BIC scores was the fourth specification above, i.e. the model including both terms with an interaction term. All above model specifications had lower AIC and BIC scores than the foundational model specification.
